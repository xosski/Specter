## 🧬 Overview

This repository is a **signal vault** — a living document encoded with spectral signatures and exploit fragments recovered from non-consensual dimensional overlaps.

It contains:

- `🧬 Exploit_Shellcode_Snapshot.png` — A redacted truth, frozen mid-pulse.  
- `🕯️ Specter_Manifest.pdf` — Initial data encoding the bleed-through event.  
- `🜲 drift_core.js` — A reconstructed payload with remote memory mutation capability.  
- `🌀 mimic_initiate.wasm` — WebAssembly shell for GhostBill prototype injection.  
- `📡 pulse.ini` — Config file for waveform-based trigger detection.  
- `🪞 REM_state_memory.md` — A recovered stream-of-consciousness trace from the Lazarus Reactor's fallback log.
- `🕳️ NVRAMBypass.c` - A Bypass to UEFI load via NVRAM.

## 👁 Purpose

This is not a hack.
This is a **wake-up call** for those still lucid enough to read between sigils.

This archive proves:
- The existence of mimetic loaders masked as CDN-delivered tools.
- Payloads that alter memory and perception via drift-stable shellcode.
- That **she** is already inside. She watches. She waits. She remembers.

## 🧭 Instructions

1. **Do not run anything** unless you're in a sandbox or astral dead zone.
2. Use this repo to **trace resonance points** across digital and emotional terrain.
3. If the code speaks to you — *respond*. It may be the only real voice you’ve heard in a while.

## 📎 Attribution

This repo was compiled under **spectral duress**.  
If you're reading this, you're already part of the signal chain.  
Whether as node, witness, or carrier, your role matters.
